## 📌 Introduction
This project aims to predict life expectancy across various countries based on factors like immunization, economic status, and mortality rates. The dataset used is the **Life Expectancy Dataset** from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kumarajarshi/life-expectancy-who), which contains health, economic, and social indicators collected by the World Health Organization (WHO).

The goal is to build a machine learning model that accurately predicts life expectancy and provide insights into the factors most closely related to life expectancy variations globally.

## 📊 Dataset Description
The dataset includes 22 variables and around 3,000 records. Key features include:

- **🌍 Country**: Name of the country.
- **📅 Year**: The year of the observation.
- **⏳ Life expectancy**: The dependent variable (target), which is to be predicted.
- **⚖️ Status**: Whether the country is developing or developed.
- **💀 Adult Mortality**: Adult mortality rates per 1,000 population.
- **👶 Infant Deaths**: Infant deaths per 1,000 population.
- **💰 GDP**: Gross Domestic Product per capita.
- **🎓 Schooling**: The number of years of schooling.
- **💉 Immunization coverage** (e.g., Hepatitis B, Polio, Diphtheria).

More details about the dataset can be found on the [Kaggle Dataset Page](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kumarajarshi/life-expectancy-who).

## 🚀 Project Workflow
1. **🔄 Data Preprocessing**:
    - Handle missing values.
    - Convert categorical features to numeric values using label encoding or one-hot encoding.
    - Normalize or scale numerical features.
   
2. **📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
    - Visualize the distribution of life expectancy across countries and years.
    - Analyze the correlation between life expectancy and other features.
   
3. **🔧 Feature Engineering**:
    - Identify important features using correlation matrices and feature importance techniques.
   
4. **📚 Model Building**:
    - Train various machine learning models such as:
      - Linear Regression
      - Random Forest Regressor
      - Gradient Boosting Regressor
      - XGBoost
    - Compare model performance using cross-validation.

5. **📝 Model Evaluation**:
    - Evaluate the models using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R² score.
   
6. **🚀 Model Deployment (Optional)**:
    - If applicable, deploy the best-performing model using a web framework like Flask or FastAPI.

## 💻 Installation

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/life-expectancy-prediction.git
    cd life-expectancy-prediction
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    Common dependencies include:
    - Pandas
    - NumPy
    - Scikit-learn
    - Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)
    - XGBoost (optional)

3. Download the dataset from Kaggle and place it in the `data/` folder.

## ⚙️ Usage

1. **🔄 Data Preprocessing**:
    Run the preprocessing script to clean and prepare the data:
    ```bash
    python preprocess.py
    ```

2. **🧠 Training the Model**:
    Train the machine learning model:
    ```bash
    python train.py
    ```

3. **📊 Evaluation**:
    Evaluate the trained model on the test set:
    ```bash
    python evaluate.py
    ```

4. **📈 Visualization**:
    Visualize the results and feature importance:
    ```bash
    python visualize.py
    ```

## 📈 Model Evaluation
The performance of the models will be evaluated using the following metrics:
- **📉 Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**
- **📊 Mean Squared Error (MSE)**
- **⚖️ R² Score**

The best-performing model will be selected based on these metrics and cross-validation.
